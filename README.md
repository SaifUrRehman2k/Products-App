🛍️ Products App – My First React Project
This is my first project built using React, created during a web development course. The goal was to design a simple yet functional product listing page that showcases a set of fake products and demonstrates core React concepts.

🔧 Features
> Product Listing Page: Displays a collection of products with basic details like name, price, and image.

> Routing with React Router: Implemented multiple pages using react-router-dom, including:

  > Home page

  > Products page

  > Individual product detail pages

> Fake Data Integration: Used mock product data to simulate a real-world e-commerce experience.

> Component-Based Architecture: Built reusable components for product cards, headers, and layout.

> Responsive Design: Ensured the layout adapts well to different screen sizes.

📚 What I Learned
> How to set up a React project using Vite

> Creating and managing components

> Using useState and useEffect hooks

> Navigating between pages using React Router

> Passing props and managing simple state

> Structuring a project for scalability

🚀 Future Improvements
> Add filtering and sorting functionality

> Integrate real API data
